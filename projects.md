<h3 class="project-title">I. Fairness or Threat? Understanding Sources of Immigration Backlash in Democracies</h3>

<div class="project-meta">

<span><strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (Leiden University)</span>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>Immigration is one of the most contentious political issues in contemporary democracies, generating public backlash and policy instability. Explanations for immigration attitudes have traditionally emphasized two perspectives: group threat theory, which holds that dominant groups react defensively when immigration challenges cultural identity, national character, or established hierarchies; and economic competition theory, which views attitudes as shaped by perceived individual or national economic risks. Recent work introduces a third perspective: civic fairness, which claims that citizens assess immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially superseding both group-based concerns and economic calculations.</p>

<p>This project extends the civic fairness framework by testing whether perceptions of fairness override, complement, or contradict threat- and competition-based considerations across different democratic contexts. Do citizens support immigration policies they see as fair, even when these policies challenge cultural boundaries? Do they reject immigration they perceive as unfair, even when it benefits the economy? And do such fairness-based judgments operate similarly across countries with different institutions, civic legacies, and migration histories?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, the project employs experimental surveys in the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore, providing a systematic cross-national test of civic fairness as a distinct driver of immigration attitudes in democracies.</p>

<h3 class="project-title">II. Contesting the Nation: Digital Pipelines and the Historical Analysis of National History Textbooks</h3>

<div class="project-meta">
<span><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing</span>
<span><strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (Leiden University)</span>
<span><strong>Collaborator:</strong> Aron van de Pol (Leiden University)</span>
<span><strong>Funding:</strong> Leiden University (internal); developed for local GPU and HPC infrastructure</span>
</div>

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project develops reproducible digital pipelines for extracting and analyzing text from scanned and already digitized education documents, with a focus on history textbooks, in order to study how states construct, contest, and institutionalize narratives of national identity across time. By integrating OCR and vision-language model workflows with large language model interpretation and standard text-as-data methods, the project generates clean, searchable corpora that enable systematic, cross-period comparisons of how regimes frame origins, membership, and belonging.</p>

<p>The research examines how official narratives evolve across regime transitions and how they define the boundaries of the political community. Special attention is paid to periods of rupture, with a focus on political liberalization and democratization, when competing visions of nationhood surface most sharply and when educational texts become key tools of legitimation.</p>

<h3 class="project-title">III. Nationalism and Political Change: Why Institutions Matter for National Identity and Belonging</h3>

<div class="project-meta">
<span><strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (2024-25)</span>
<span><strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (University of Vienna)</span>
<span><strong>Funding:</strong> Academy of Korean Studies; University of Vienna</span>
</div>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project focuses on the relationship between political system change and preferences for national membership and belonging. Existing research suggests that preferences and institutions align and that citizens in democracies have national identities that are more open and inclusive than those in authoritarian countries, but it remains unclear how democratization affects national identity in newer democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies. Are the identities forged under autocratic regimes resilient over time, or do they change? Can democratization lead to new and inclusive attitudes towards national membership and belonging, as theory suggests?</p>

<p>To answer these questions, the project utilizes cross-sectional data that measures attitudes toward national identity, immigration, diversity, and related variables in (South) Korea, Germany, and Taiwan, supplemented by new survey experiments and other data sources.</p>

<p>The research contributes to our understanding of the effects of political system change on national membership, including national identity preferences and attitudes toward immigration. It also provides important insights into the challenges facing democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies for integrating newcomers from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project explores the challenges and opportunities associated with the social integration of people in divided nations, concentrating specifically on Germany's reunification experience and the present-day assimilation of North Korean defector-migrants into South Korea. The research aims to inform future planning for unification in South Korea and contribute to the overall stability of the Northeast Asian region.</p>

<p>Drawing from the lessons learned during Germany's reunification, this research applies these insights to the South Korean context while also considering the broader dynamics of the Northeast Asian region. By identifying effective strategies for managing the complex integration process in a potential future unification scenario on the Korean peninsula, the study aims to facilitate the pursuit of a more peaceful future.</p>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>A collaborative effort between researchers from the University of Toronto, University of Vienna, Toronto Metropolitan University, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and other institutions, this project aims to explore the landscape of high-performing firms, known as "scale-ups," and their impact on key policy objectives, such as employment gains, technological innovation, and economic competitiveness.</p>

<p>Using administrative micro-files linked to financial and survey data, the project evaluates the economic impact of scale-ups conceptualized and measured across different economic dimensions through descriptive and economic analyses. The project also uses a new database containing innovation-related programs of the federal government (Business Innovation and Growth Support, or BIGS) to examine the impact of innovation support on the economic behavior of high-performing firms.</p>

<h3 class="project-title">Information Dissemination in North Korea</h3>

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>In collaboration with the NGO Woorion and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), this project seeks to identify the determinants of non-state information dissemination within North Korean society and how these information flows can be promoted. More broadly, the research contributes to the literature on political control in authoritarian systems.</p>

<p>In North Korea, the state's monopoly on information was shattered during the famine of the 1990s. Some North Koreans have since become regular consumers of foreign media, including South Korean and US media. This project explores the use and circulation of illicit foreign information among citizens in North Korea using experimental and observational survey questions supported by qualitative insights.</p>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project investigates public attitudes and public policies regarding migrant entrepreneurship and integration. Leveraging the case of North Korean migrant resettlement and integration in South Korea, otherwise known as "unification in action," this research explores natives' preferences for the economic, political, and social integration of co-ethnic migrants.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it examines how the structure of government support for migrant entrepreneurship policies affects public attitudes toward business support expansion. The study's findings have implications for integration and resettlement policy in South Korea and contribute to the broader migration and citizenship literature.</p>
