# Projects

This page provides an overview of the research projects currently active or recently completed in which I served as the primary investigator or co-investigator.

Currently, my research program is organized around three projects that collectively examine how national identity and belonging are shaped in democratic and democratizing societies.

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>Immigration is one of the most contentious political issues in contemporary democracies, generating public backlash and policy instability. Explanations for immigration attitudes have traditionally emphasized two perspectives: group threat theory, which holds that dominant groups react defensively when immigration challenges cultural identity, national character, or established hierarchies; and economic competition theory, which views attitudes as shaped by perceived individual or national economic risks. Recent work introduces a third perspective: civic fairness, which claims that citizens assess immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially superseding both group-based concerns and economic calculations.</p>
<p>This project extends the civic fairness framework by testing whether perceptions of fairness override, complement, or contradict threat- and competition-based considerations across different democratic contexts. The project employs experimental surveys in the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore.</p>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project sits at the intersection of digital humanities and social science, using text analysis and survey methods to study how national identity is constructed and transmitted through education. Working with a corpus of South Korean national history textbooks spanning from 1948 through 2016, collected from the National Institute of Korean History and the Georg Eckert Institute, the project covers the post-liberation authoritarian regimes and the democratic era, each presenting different grand narratives of the Korean nation.</p>
<p>The project proceeds in two stages. First, we use AI-assisted text analysis to identify how the nation is narrated across different periods and what type of national identity is articulated in each era's textbooks. Second, we design a survey experiment that draws directly from these textbook-derived narratives, asking South Koreans to evaluate competing versions of the nation rather than respond to abstract hypotheticals. This design allows us to test whether individuals favor the version of the nation that reflects what they learned during their school years, as theories of long-run political socialization would predict.</p>

<h3>III. Nationalism and Political Change: Why Institutions Matter for National Identity and Belonging</h3>

<p class="project-meta">
<strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (2024-25) · <strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (University of Vienna) · <strong>Funding:</strong> Academy of Korean Studies; University of Vienna

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project focuses on the relationship between political system change and preferences for national membership and belonging. Existing research suggests that preferences and institutions align and that citizens in democracies have national identities that are more open and inclusive than those in authoritarian countries, but it remains unclear how democratization affects national identity in newer democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies.</p>
<p>The project utilizes cross-sectional data that measures attitudes toward national identity, immigration, diversity, and related variables in (South) Korea, Germany, and Taiwan, supplemented by new survey experiments and other data sources.</p>
