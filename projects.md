# Projects

This page provides an overview of the research projects currently active or recently completed in which I served as the primary investigator or co-investigator.

Currently, my research program is organized around three projects that collectively examine how national identity and belonging are shaped in democratic and democratizing societies.

## Active Projects

<div class="project-card">
<h3>I. Fairness or Threat? Understanding Sources of Immigration Backlash in Democracies</h3>

<p class="project-meta">
<strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (2025-2026) · <strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (Leiden University) · <strong>Funding:</strong> Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)
</p>

<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>Immigration is one of the most contentious political issues in contemporary democracies, generating public backlash and policy instability. Explanations for immigration attitudes have traditionally emphasized two perspectives: group threat theory, which holds that dominant groups react defensively when immigration challenges cultural identity, national character, or established hierarchies; and economic competition theory, which views attitudes as shaped by perceived individual or national economic risks. Recent work introduces a third perspective: civic fairness, which claims that citizens assess immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially superseding both group-based concerns and economic calculations.</p>
<p>This project extends the civic fairness framework by testing whether perceptions of fairness override, complement, or contradict threat- and competition-based considerations across different democratic contexts. The project employs experimental surveys in the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore.</p>

<h3>II. Contesting the Nation: Digital Pipelines and the Historical Analysis of National History Textbooks</h3>

<p class="project-meta">
<strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing · <strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (Leiden University) · <strong>Collaborator:</strong> Aron van de Pol (Leiden University) · <strong>Funding:</strong> Leiden University (internal)
</p>

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project develops reproducible digital pipelines for extracting and analyzing text from scanned and already digitized education documents, with a focus on history textbooks, in order to study how states construct, contest, and institutionalize narratives of national identity across time. By integrating OCR and vision-language model workflows with large language model interpretation and standard text-as-data methods, the project generates clean, searchable corpora that enable systematic, cross-period comparisons of how regimes frame origins, membership, and belonging.</p>

<h3>III. Nationalism and Political Change: Why Institutions Matter for National Identity and Belonging</h3>

<p class="project-meta">
<strong>Duration:</strong> 12 months (2024-25) · <strong>PI:</strong> Steven Denney (University of Vienna) · <strong>Funding:</strong> Academy of Korean Studies; University of Vienna
</p>

<details>
<summary>Overview</summary>
<div>
<p>This project focuses on the relationship between political system change and preferences for national membership and belonging. Existing research suggests that preferences and institutions align and that citizens in democracies have national identities that are more open and inclusive than those in authoritarian countries, but it remains unclear how democratization affects national identity in newer democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies.</p>
<p>The project utilizes cross-sectional data that measures attitudes toward national identity, immigration, diversity, and related variables in (South) Korea, Germany, and Taiwan, supplemented by new survey experiments and other data sources.</p>
