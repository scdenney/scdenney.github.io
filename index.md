title: About

I am an assistant professor of International Relations and Korean Studies at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), where I work at the intersection of digital humanities and quantitative social science to study questions of national identity, migration, and political change.

Mainly, I am interested in relationship between institutions and individual preferences, such as the relationship between democracy and national identity. I use surveys and experimental designs to analyze public opinion and political behavior, but I am working increasingly more on machine learning for text analysis and developing pipelines that integrate OCR, vision-language models, and large language models to analyze large quantities of text. 

Motivated and informed by my research, I teach courses on computational text analysis, comparative politics, and Korean studies at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Beyond Leiden, I serve as Director of Research at [SinoNK.com](http://sinonk.com), a Senior Fellow at the [European Centre for North Korean Studies](https://ecnk.univie.ac.at/) at the University of Vienna, and a Non-Resident Fellow in the [Innovation Policy Lab](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/ipl/) at the University of Toronto. These affiliations reflect my commitment to publicly engaged scholarship and policy-relevant research.

I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toronto, an M.A. in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University, and a B.A. in Political Science from Harding University.
