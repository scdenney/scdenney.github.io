# About Me

I am an assistant professor of International Relations and Korean Studies at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), where I bridge digital humanities with quantitative social science to study questions of national identity, migration, and political change.

My research sits at the intersection of computational methods and political inquiry. I design and deploy survey experiments, leverage machine learning for text analysis, and develop reproducible pipelines that integrate OCR, vision-language models, and large language models (LLMs) to analyze historical documents at scale. Whether exploring how citizens form attitudes toward immigration or how states construct national narratives through education, I bring together the rigor of quantitative political science with the interpretive depth of humanistic inquiry.

Beyond Leiden, I serve as Director of Research at [SinoNK.com](http://sinonk.com), a Senior Fellow at the [European Centre for North Korean Studies](https://ecnk.univie.ac.at/) at the University of Vienna, and a Non-Resident Fellow in the [Innovation Policy Lab](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/ipl/) at the University of Toronto. These affiliations reflect my commitment to publicly engaged scholarship and policy-relevant research.

My substantive interests center on migration and governance, nations and nationalism, and international organization. I am particularly drawn to understanding how political institutions shape—and are shaped by—conceptions of national identity and belonging. I teach courses on computational text analysis, comparative politics, and Korean studies at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Methodologically, I work primarily with surveys and experimental designs to analyze public opinion and political behavior. I also use computational approaches to analyze text as data, including topic modeling, embeddings, and other natural language processing techniques. A current focus is exploring how large language models can augment or extend conventional methods in the study of political discourse—not as replacements for careful analysis, but as tools that open new possibilities for scale and interpretation.

I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toronto, an M.A. in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University, and a B.A. in Political Science from Harding University.
