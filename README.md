Born and raised in the suburbs of St. Louis, Missouri, I am a Midwesterner at heart, but I have had the privilege of experiencing personal and professional growth in many different places. Above all, I am a devoted partner to a loving spouse and an accomplished translator.
Currently, I am an assistant professor of International Relations and Korean Studies at Leiden University.
I am also a director of research at SinoNK.com, a senior fellow at the European Centre for North Korean Studies at the University of Vienna, and a non-resident fellow in the Innovation Policy Lab at the University of Toronto.
Trained as a political scientist, I conduct research on migration and governance, nations and nationalism, and international organization. I am particularly interested in the relationship between nationalism and political institutions. I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on computational text analysis, comparative politics, and area studies. 
My work relies primarily on surveys and experimental designs to analyze public opinion and political behavior, but I also use computational approaches to analyze text as data, including topic modeling and other natural language processing techniques. I am currently exploring how large language models (LLMs) can augment or extend conventional methods in the study of political discourse. [review this for accuracy and better sounding profile; needs to better emphasis my connections to machine learning, AI, quant poli sci + surveys and how i connect digital humanities with quantiative social science << this is my identity here at leiden; let’s bring it out]
I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Toronto, an M.A. in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University, and a B.A. in Political Science from Harding University.

<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Projects</strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This page provides an overview of the research projects currently active or recently completed in which I served as the primary investigator or co-investigator. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Currently, my research program is organized around three projects that collectively examine how national identity and belonging are shaped in democratic and democratizing societies. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first project, <em>Fairness or Threat? Understanding Sources of Immigration Backlash in Democracies, </em>examines the foundations of immigration attitudes, exploring when publics perceive migration as a threat, an economic burden, or a matter of fairness. Its contribution is to bring competing theoretical perspectives into direct comparison and to test them through cross-national survey experiments, with a focus on "fairness" as a potentially portable theoretical model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second project, <em>Contesting the Nation: Digital Pipelines and the Historical Analysis of National History Textbooks,</em> develops reproducible pipelines for analyzing historical texts, tracing how official narratives of nationhood shift across regimes and moments of rupture. Its distinctive feature is the integration of OCR, vision–language models, and computational text analysis, creating tools for studying how educational materials frame belonging over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The third project, <em>Nationalism and Political Change: Why Institutions Matter for National Identity and Belonging,</em> examines how democratization and institutional legacies shape national identity and membership preferences in societies with authoritarian or ethnocultural pasts. By combining cross-sectional surveys with experimental designs, it highlights how institutional change can both enable and constrain more inclusive forms of belonging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together, these projects integrate theoretical inquiry with innovative methods, including survey and experimental research, cross-national opinion analysis, and computational approaches to historical texts. Read more about the projects, including recently concluded ones, below.</p>

<p><em>Principal Investigator:</em> Steven Denney (Leiden University)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> Immigration is one of the most contentious political issues in contemporary democracies, generating public backlash and policy instability. Explanations for immigration attitudes have traditionally emphasized two perspectives: group threat theory, which holds that dominant groups react defensively when immigration challenges cultural identity, national character, or established hierarchies; and economic competition theory, which views attitudes as shaped by perceived individual or national economic risks. Recent work introduces a third perspective: civic fairness, which claims that citizens assess immigration through moral principles of legal compliance and equal opportunity, potentially superseding both group-based concerns and economic calculations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This project extends the civic fairness framework by testing whether perceptions of fairness override, complement, or contradict threat- and competition-based considerations across different democratic contexts. Do citizens support immigration policies they see as fair, even when these policies challenge cultural boundaries? Do they reject immigration they perceive as unfair, even when it benefits the economy? And do such fairness-based judgments operate similarly across countries with different institutions, civic legacies, and migration histories?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To answer these questions, the project employs experimental surveys in the United States, Germany, South Korea, and Singapore, providing a systematic cross-national test of civic fairness as a distinct driver of immigration attitudes in democracies.</p>

<p><em>Principal Investigator:</em> Steven Denney (Leiden University)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> In collaboration with Aron van de Pol (Leiden University), this project develops reproducible digital pipelines for extracting and analyzing text from scanned and already digitized education documents, with a focus on history textbooks, in order to study how states construct, contest, and institutionalize narratives of national identity across time. By integrating OCR and vision–language model workflows with large language model interpretation and standard text-as-data methods, the project generates clean, searchable corpora that enable systematic, cross-period comparisons of how regimes frame origins, membership, and belonging.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research examines how official narratives evolve across regime transitions and how they define the boundaries of the political community. Special attention is paid to periods of rupture, with a focus on political liberalization and democratization, when competing visions of nationhood surface most sharply and when educational texts become key tools of legitimation.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> This project focuses on the relationship between political system change and preferences for national membership and belonging. Existing research suggests that preferences and institutions align and that citizens in democracies have national identities that are more open and inclusive than those in authoritarian countries, but it remains unclear how democratization affects national identity in newer democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies. Are the identities forged under autocratic regimes resilient over time, or do they change? Can democratization lead to new and inclusive attitudes towards national membership and belonging, as theory suggests? To answer these questions, the project utilizes cross-sectional data that measures attitudes toward national identity, immigration, diversity, and related variables in (South) Korea, Germany, and Taiwan, supplemented by new survey experiments and other data sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The research contributes to our understanding of the effects of political system change on national membership, including national identity preferences and attitudes toward immigration. It also provides important insights into the challenges facing democracies with authoritarian and ethnocultural legacies for integrating newcomers from diverse backgrounds. Ultimately, this research can help inform policies and programs to promote more inclusive and cohesive societies for newly diverse and transitioning societies.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Integration Challenges and Opportunities in Divided Countries</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:details -->
<details class="wp-block-details"><summary><strong style="font-size: 16px">Overview</strong></summary><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Duration:</em> 12 months (2024-25) </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Principal Investigator:</em> Steven Denney (University of Vienna)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> This project explores the challenges and opportunities associated with the social integration of people in divided nations, concentrating specifically on Germany's reunification experience and the present-day assimilation of North Korean defector-migrants into South Korea. The research aims to inform future planning for unification in South Korea and contribute to the overall stability of the Northeast Asian region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reunification of Germany in 1990 and the ongoing efforts to integrate newcomers from North Korea into South Korean society are comparable cases worth comparing. These experiences offer valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities when two distinct societies with different political, economic, and social systems are brought together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Drawing from the lessons learned during Germany's reunification, this research will apply these insights to the South Korean context while also considering the broader dynamics of the Northeast Asian region. By identifying effective strategies for managing the complex integration process in a potential future unification scenario on the Korean peninsula, the study aims to facilitate the pursuit of a more peaceful future.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, the research findings can inform policies that promote social cohesion, tolerance, and empathy within South Korean society today, ultimately fostering a more inclusive environment for North Korean defectors and other minority groups. Finally, this research will enhance public diplomacy efforts by providing a Central European perspective on promoting stability in Northeast Asia.</p>

<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A collaborative effort between researchers from the University of Toronto, University of Vienna, Toronto Metropolitan University, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, and other institutions, this project aims to explore the landscape of high-performing firms, known as "scale-ups," and their impact on key policy objectives, such as employment gains, technological innovation, and economic competitiveness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> This project addresses the lack of clarity surrounding the definition and identification of scale-ups, despite their potential for fulfilling key policy objectives and promoting national prosperity. Using administrative micro-files linked to financial and survey data, the project evaluates the economic impact of scale-ups conceptualized and measured across different economic dimensions through descriptive and economic analyses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition, the project uses a new database containing innovation-related programs of the federal government (<a href="https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&amp;SDDS=5304">Business Innovation and Growth Support</a>, or BIGS) to examine the impact of innovation support on the economic behavior of high-performing firms using program analysis methods. </p>

<p><em>Principal Investigators:</em> Steven Denney (University of Vienna) and Peter Ward (Kookmin University)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> In collaboration with the NGO Woorion and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), this project seeks to identify the determinants of non-state information dissemination within North Korean society and how this information flows can be promoted. More broadly, the research contributes to the literature on political control in authoritarian systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In North Korea, the state’s monopoly on information was shattered during the famine of the 1990s. Some North Koreans have since become regular consumers of foreign media, including South Korean and US media, such as TV shows and current affairs content. But what kind of information do they consume and disseminate, and why? To answer this question, we explore the use and circulation of illicit foreign information among citizens in North Korea using experimental and observation survey questions supported by qualitative insights.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Unification in Action? North Korean Migrant Integration and Support Expansion</h3>

<p><em>Principal Investigators:</em> Steven Denney (University of Vienna), Christopher Green (Leiden University), and Peter Ward (Kookmin University)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Project Overview:</em> This project investigates public attitudes and public policies regarding migrant entrepreneurship and integration. Leveraging the case of North Korean migrant resettlement and integration in South Korea, otherwise known as 'unification in action’, this research explores natives' preferences for the economic, political, and social integration of co-ethnic migrants. Furthermore, it examines how the structure of government support for migrant entrepreneurship policies affects public attitudes toward business support expansion. Additionally, the research considers the trade-offs between different policy options for unification between North and South Korea. The study's findings have implications for integration and resettlement policy in South Korea and contribute to the broader migration and citizenship literature.</p>
