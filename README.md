I bridge digital humanities with quantitative social science to study national identity, migration, and political change.

## Research Focus

- Survey experiments and experimental designs
- Machine learning and computational text analysis
- Large language models for political discourse
- Nations, nationalism, and immigration attitudes

## Current Projects
